### An user-friendly, clean and professional approach to third party mod/tool installation.
SIA is a setup application which aims to make the process of installing custom tools or modifications to third party applications (such as videogames) more user-friendly through an assisted installation process specifically designed to "casualize" modding. This tool aims to:
- Improve the end-user experience with our mods/tools by presenting them in a more "professional" way.
- Simplify the installation process of said mods/tools by avoiding the copy/pasting or text-editing of files when installing our mod/tools.
- Make it easier for the end-user to tweak our mods/tools through a step-based installation process.
- Offer clear installation step explanations (if necessary) to help the user better understand what they are tweaking in each step option.
- Offer image previews (if necessary) to showcase the end-result of the installed application.

## USE CASES
SIA is not intended to replace mod management tools.

This software has been developed as a potential QOL improvement to any lightweight modification suporting this installation method.\
SIA is intended to be applied on mod or tools which are installed on the actual third party software data folder (i.e. software executable directory, videogame save data location...).\
It's not adviced to use SIA on use cases where the mod can be installed through a mod manager (i.e. Mod Organizer, Vortex...).

Some great use case scenarios for SIA are (but are not limited to):
- Complex post-processing mods such as ENBs or ReShades where the user can tweak LUTs or other features to customize the end result.
- Videogame engine tweak collections where the user can decide which plugins they want to enable or not.
- Application overlays.
